# 03 · The Prompt Builder (Python)

## Setup

This step (and every later Python step) shares a single virtualenv at the
**repo root**, so it only needs to be created once:

```bash
# from the repo root
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r week1_baseline/python/03_prompt_builder/requirements.txt
```

The launcher at `week1_baseline/bin/python/03_prompt_builder` assumes
`.venv` already exists at the repo root and has these dependencies
installed.

Because LLM access, cost and quality are constantly changing, we want to be
able to switch between multiple LLMs that will drive the agent loop.

There are several SDKs that provide access to many LLMs but in practice we
only really need to focus on top-tier models:
- anthropic family
- openai family
- gemini family
- ollama cloud eg. kimi, minimax, llama

The Prompt Builder serializes `Context` for the exact format each API
expects. The `PromptBuilder` delegates to whichever backend you pass in.

PromptBuilder does not call the API, we are simply preparing the format for
API calls.

Configuration is task-based here, carried forward from the registry step.
The `player` task owns its provider, model, and prompt override settings,
and the context records the task that the prompt is being built for.

| `boukensha/prompt_builder.py` | Delegates serialization to the active backend |
| `boukensha/tasks/base.py` | Abstract task helper for provider/model and prompt resolution (unchanged from `02_the_registry`) |
| `boukensha/tasks/player.py` | The concrete player task used by the main loop (unchanged from `02_the_registry`) |
| `prompts/system.md` | Default system prompt used when a task does not override it |
| `boukensha/backends/base.py` | Shared backend contract for model validation and model metadata |

## How It Works

```
Context (Python objects)
        ↓
PromptBuilder
        ↓
Backend (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, or Ollama)
        ↓
API Payload (plain dicts and lists)
        ↓
POST to API
```

## `boukensha.PromptBuilder`

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `to_messages()` | Delegates message serialization to the backend |
| `to_tools()` | Delegates tool serialization to the backend |
| `to_api_payload(max_output_tokens=1024)` | Assembles the complete payload ready to POST |
| `headers()` | Returns the correct headers for the backend |
| `url()` | Returns the correct endpoint URL for the backend |

## Backends

Each API has its own conventions for how data is expected. Anthropic and
Gemini are the most alike (system prompt as a top-level field), while
OpenAI and Ollama share the same `function`-wrapped tool schema.

Backends also own their supported model table. A backend refuses to
initialize with an unknown model, so `settings.yaml` cannot silently select
an unsupported or misspelled model. Each model entry carries:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `context_window` | The model's known token context window |
| `cost_per_million["input"]` | USD input token price per million tokens, when known |
| `cost_per_million["output"]` | USD output token price per million tokens, when known |
| `usage_unit` | `"tokens"`, `"local_compute"`, or `"ollama_cloud_usage"` |
| `usage_level` | Ollama Cloud usage tier, when applicable |

Backend instances expose `context_window`, `input_token_cost_per_million`,
`output_token_cost_per_million`, `usage_unit`, `usage_level`, and
`estimate_cost(input_tokens, output_tokens)`.
For local Ollama models, token API cost is `0.0`. For Ollama Cloud, public
pricing is plan/usage based rather than token based, so `estimate_cost`
returns `None`.

The prices in this step are static tutorial data, current as of June 16,
2026, and should be reviewed whenever the selected model set changes.

### System Prompt

Anthropic and Gemini send the system prompt as a top-level field, separate
from the messages array. Ollama and OpenAI put it inside the messages array
as a `role: system` message.

```json
// Anthropic
{ "system": "You are a MUD player assistant.", "messages": [ ... ] }

// Gemini
{ "systemInstruction": { "parts": [{ "text": "You are a MUD player assistant." }] }, "contents": [ ... ] }

// Ollama / OpenAI
{ "messages": [ { "role": "system", "content": "You are a MUD player assistant." }, ... ] }
```

### Tool Results

Anthropic wraps tool results in a user message. Ollama and OpenAI use their
own `role: tool` message type (with slightly different identifier fields).
Gemini wraps results in a `functionResponse` part on a `user` message.

```json
// Anthropic
{ "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": "toolu_01X", "content": "A damp stone corridor stretches north. Torches flicker on the walls." }] }

// Ollama
{ "role": "tool", "tool_name": "look", "content": "A damp stone corridor stretches north. Torches flicker on the walls." }

// OpenAI
{ "role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "toolu_01X", "content": "A damp stone corridor stretches north. Torches flicker on the walls." }

// Gemini
{ "role": "user", "parts": [{ "functionResponse": { "name": "toolu_01X", "response": { "content": "A damp stone corridor stretches north. Torches flicker on the walls." } } }] }
```

### Tool Definitions

Anthropic uses `input_schema`. Ollama and OpenAI wrap everything in a
`function` envelope with `parameters`. Gemini wraps tools in a
`functionDeclarations` array.

```json
// Anthropic
{ "name": "move", "description": "Move the player in a direction (north, south, east, west, up, down)", "input_schema": { "type": "object", "properties": { "direction": { "type": "string", "description": "The direction to move" } }, "required": ["direction"] } }

// Ollama / OpenAI
{ "type": "function", "function": { "name": "move", "description": "Move the player in a direction (north, south, east, west, up, down)", "parameters": { "type": "object", "properties": { "direction": { "type": "string", "description": "The direction to move" } }, "required": ["direction"] } } }

// Gemini
{ "functionDeclarations": [ { "name": "move", "description": "Move the player in a direction (north, south, east, west, up, down)", "parameters": { "type": "object", "properties": { "direction": { "type": "string", "description": "The direction to move" } }, "required": ["direction"] } } ] }
```

### Message Roles

Anthropic, Ollama, and OpenAI all use `assistant` for the model's turn.
Gemini calls it `model`.

```json
// Anthropic / Ollama / OpenAI
{ "role": "assistant", "content": "Let me take a look around first." }

// Gemini
{ "role": "model", "parts": [{ "text": "Let me take a look around first." }] }
```

## Considerations

**The conversation is stateless.** The model has no memory between turns.
Every API call includes the entire history from the beginning. BOUKENSHA is
responsible for carrying that state.

**Tool results are user messages on Anthropic.** This feels
counterintuitive — the result came from BOUKENSHA, not the human — but it
reflects how the Anthropic API models the conversation. Ollama, OpenAI, and
Gemini all handle this with dedicated message/part types instead.

**The agent only sees schemas.** The `description` field on each tool is
the only thing the agent uses to decide which tool to call. The actual
block never leaves BOUKENSHA.

**`estimate_cost` needs an explicit `None` check, not a truthy check.**
Ruby's `return nil unless a && b` works because `0.0` is truthy in Ruby —
local Ollama models really do have `0.0` costs, and that check correctly
lets `estimate_cost` proceed to compute `0.0` for them. In Python, `0.0` is
falsy, so a literal `if not (a and b): return None` would wrongly treat
those same `0.0`-cost models as if their cost were unknown. This port uses
`if input_cost is None or output_cost is None: return None` instead, so
`0.0` (Ollama local) and `None` (Ollama Cloud, where pricing is plan-based)
are told apart correctly.

## Run Example

```sh
./week1_baseline/bin/python/03_prompt_builder
```

## Note for Future

At the moment, we have multiple models as options in the code. However, we
will only use Claude for now. I do need to get the keys from another
provider.
